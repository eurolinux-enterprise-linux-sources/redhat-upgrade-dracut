redhat-upgrade-dracut - initramfs environment for RHEL Upgrades
========================================================
Will Woods <wwoods@redhat.com>

This is 'redhat-upgrade-dracut', the initramfs environment for RHEL Upgrades.

Components
----------

It has the following parts:

`90system-upgrade/`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module provides a (distro-neutral) framework for running upgrades.

* Adds three dracut hooks: `upgrade-pre`, `upgrade`, and `upgrade-post`.
* Adds `upgrade.target`, which runs the above hooks (in order)
* Automatically includes any other modules named `system-upgrade-*`
* 'BONUS:' adds system-upgrade-shell.service

`85system-upgrade-redhat/`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the RHEL 'system-upgrade' implementation.

* Includes upgrade tool, SELinux policy, plymouth, etc.
* Copies initramfs to `$NEWROOT/system-upgrade-root`
* Runs 'system-upgrade-redhat' binary in the `upgrade` hook
* Save log & journal to `/var/log/upgrade.{log,journal}` before reboot

`system-upgrade-redhat.c`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The actual upgrade tool.

* Upgrades system using packages from `$UPGRADELINK`
* Sends progress updates to `plymouthd`
* Sends status output to console + journal

The actual upgrade setup is handled in the main 'redhat-upgrade-tool' package, which can be
found here: https://github.com/dashea/redhat-upgrade-tool
